"""
This is mini project for Module 1 of Algorithmic Thinking 
course on Coursera from Rice Uni. 
The script calculates in-degree as well as in- degree dist
for digraphs represented by adjacency lists. It uses 3 test
digraphs and also introduces a function to generate a full graph

Added a function normalizing in_degree, and fixed in_degree calculating algorithm
